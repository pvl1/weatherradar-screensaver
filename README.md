# weatherradar-screensaver
this currently uses gifview as a screensaver. This is by no means secure. But it works. Hope to find a better alternative or solution. Ultimate goal is to port to webkit to use with something like cinnamon-screensaver.

TODO: add instructions for adding this to available screensavers.
